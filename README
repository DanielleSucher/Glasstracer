An experimental simplified ray-tracer, which will ultimately allow you to input any image and see what it would look like when seen through a slab of glass of the specified thickness. Currently shows what the input image looks like when seen through a certain window into the world, but no glass slab has been implemented yet.

To use, first install numpy, then stick your starter image in the same directory and you can just do: python glasstracer.py -i test_img.jpg (with whatever image you like, of course)
